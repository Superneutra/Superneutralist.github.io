  <h2>First Post!</h2>
  <p id="post">Hello! This is the first of hopefully a long running list of posts exploring my life and thoughts.For this first blog I am just giving an update to what my experience has been like trying to get 
   this website to work ðŸ™ƒ
  </p> 
  <p>It has been a journey lol.</p>
  <p>
   I learned how to register a domain, learned how to host a website, learned how to start html code, learned how to link to different directories within that code, learned, learned, learned. There is a lot to learn. 
  </p>
  <p>
   Truth is that it has been fun. I am enjoying the process, feel like I am being productive, and learning skills that may actually come in handy in the future (maybe a website with a real purpose ðŸ˜¶).
  </p>
  <p>
   Some of my current goals for this website are as follows:
  
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Create a side bar</li>
  <li>Start a gallery</li>
  <li>Stylize the website</li>
  <li>Other things..</li>
  </ul> 
  <p>
   That's all I got for now, hopefully this helps to understand where I am at for the moment. 
  </p>
  <p style="margin: 30px">
   Until next time, bye-bye ðŸ‘‹
